# Moovely

Moovely is a transformative app designed to enhance the mobility of disabled individuals. By connecting people in wheelchairs who require transportation with willing providers, Moovely facilitates convenient and mutually beneficial rides. Users, like Jose Antonio in our example, can easily specify their destination, desired time, and the fee they are offering. On the other side, individuals, such as Pablo, can accept these ride offers, creating a symbiotic relationship that not only fulfills practical needs but also fosters meaningful human connections.

In the described scenario, Jose Antonio opens Moovely, sets his preferences, and Pablo accepts the offer. This seamless process not only brings happiness to both parties but also contributes positively to Jose's mental well-being. Through our trials, we discovered that the social aspect of each ride, the ability to converse and enjoy the company of different people, significantly impacts the overall experience.

To ensure fair compensation for providers, Moovely incorporates a pricing structure with a predefined range that cannot be exceeded. Initially regulated based on distance covered, these prices aim to strike a balance between affordability and reasonable compensation for the service.

Moovely is a branch of the company Mooevo, operating within the same team. The project requires an initial investment of €215,000, covering all essential resources for the first year. Investors contributing to this initial funding will receive a 10% stake in Moovely shares.

The project's advantages lie in its dual role of creating a user-friendly app while promoting an existing service. An allocation of €80,000 will be dedicated to app development and maintenance over the first year. Recognizing the need for awareness, €30,000 will be invested in advertising, with a focused implementation strategy in the initial months. Legal considerations, including legal fees and paperwork, will be addressed with a budget of €15,000. Employee wages, crucial for project success, are budgeted at €90,000.

In summary, Moovely envisions creating a better world for individuals with low mobility, and the project invites potential investors and supporters to join in making this vision a reality.
